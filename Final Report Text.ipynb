    "### A short insight into the behaviour of ferromagnetic materials.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Abstract\n",
    "\n",
    "In this report, we explore the implementation of a 2D Ising model using the Metropolis algorithm in Python.\n",
    "The Ising model is of particular interest because it demonstrates a second-order phase transition depsite its relative simplicity.\n",
    "\n",
    "To study the behaviour of ferromagnetic materials, several parameters were measured and figures of the lattice was created. The simulations demonstrated a clear phase transition near critical temperature with measured parameters corresponding well to the exact solution of the Ising model.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "Ferromagnets are a class of materials that retain their magnetization in the absence of an external magnetic field. They exhibit long-range ordering at the atomic level causing the formation of domains (areas where unpaired electrons have aligned spins). Within each domain, the magnetic field is intense. In unmagnetized domains, opposite spins cancel each other's magnetic field, but in the presence of an external magnetic field, a nonzero net magnetization can occur.\n",
    "\n",
    "The long-range ordering phenomenon disappears at a certain temperature (called the Curie temperature). At this critical temperature, the system can no longer sustain spontaneous magnetization and a second-order phase transition happens. The 2-dimensional Ising model is the simplest model that describes ferromagnetism and second-order phase transitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Ising Model\n",
    "The Ising model is a square lattice, each element contains a value of \"+1\" for spin up, and \"-1\" for spin down. Each spin will only interact with its immediate neighbours. We set the boundary conditions up as a torus where spins on opposite geometric edges are considered as neighbours. The exact solution to the 2-dimensional Ising model without the presence of an external magnetic field has been solved by Lars Onsagers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Onsagers [2] showed that the model undergoes a phase transition at the critical temperature\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "    T_C = \\frac{2}{k_B \\log (\\sqrt{2} + 1)} \\approx 2.27.\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "The spontaneous magnetization that occurs at temperatures below $T_C$ is\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "    M = \\left( 1 - \\sinh^{-4} \\frac{2J}{k_B T} \\right)^{\\frac{1}{8}}.\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "To simplify the model, we will use natural units and set constants (such as $k_B$, $\\mu$, $J$, etc.) to 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Methodology\n",
    "### Metropolis algorithm\n",
    "The Ising model will take a long time to solve numerically since the number of possible states for a $N$ by $N$ square lattice is $2^N$. The Ising model is often simulated using the Monte Carlo method and the algorithm used most often is the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. The Metropolis algorithm is used to determine if a spin flips. The steps of the Metropolis algorithm are as follow:\n",
    "<ol>\n",
    "    <li> Randomly select a spin site on the lattice. </li>\n",
    "    <li> Compute the change in energy $dE$ when the spin is flipped. </li>\n",
    "    <li> If $dE \\leq 0$, the spin is flipped with probability 1. </li>\n",
    "        <li> If $dE > 0$, the spin is flipped with the probability $\\exp{\\frac{-dE}{k_B T}}$.</li>\n",
    "</ol>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Wolff algorithm [1]\n",
    "One of the limitations of the Metropolis algorithm is the occurece of \"critical slowing down\" near the critical temperature. This is due to the size of correlated regions of spin becoming larger as we approach the critical temperature. Hence, the time required for a region to lose its coherence becomes very long. Instead of performing a single spin (as in the Metropolis algorithm), the Wolff algorithm flips a cluster of spins. This is an example of a global algorithm. \n",
    "\n",
    "We introduce a bond between any 2 neighbouring spins, the probability for such. bond to exisit is $p$. The bond probability depends on the temperature and is given by:\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "    p = 1 - \\exp{-\\frac{2J}{k_B T}}.\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "We would first generate a cluster of neighbouring spins with this bond probability and then flip the cluster with probability 1. The steps of Wolff algorithm are as follow:\n",
    "<ol>\n",
    "    <li> Select a random spin site on the lattice. The neighbouring spins are known as the \"neighbours\".\n",
    "    <li> Select a neighbouring spin and generate a random number $r$, if $r \\leq p$, a bond exists between the two spins and the neighbouring spin is added to the cluster. That spin site will no longer be checked.\n",
    "    <li> If a spin is added to the cluster, its neighbouring spins will now be added into \"neighbours\".\n",
    "    <li> Repeat step 2 and 3 until no neighbouring spins remain.\n",
    "    <li> Flip every spin in the cluster.\n",
    "</ol>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Thermodynamic quantities\n",
    "The followwing thermodynamic quantities were measured:\n",
    "<ol>\n",
    "    <li> $e(i,j)$ - The energy $e$ at one specific site $(i,j)$ on a lattice $S$ (we assume there an absence of an external magnetic field) is given by:\n",
    "        \\begin{equation}\n",
    "        e(i,j) = -S(i,j) \\cdot [S(i+1,j) + S(i-i,j) + S(i,j+1) + S(i,j-1)].\n",
    "        \\end{equation}\n",
    "    <li> $E$ - The total energy $E$ is given by:\n",
    "        \\begin{equation}\n",
    "        E = \\sum_{i,j} e(i,j).\n",
    "        \\end{equation}\n",
    "    <li> $dE$ - The change in energy $dE$ for flipping one spin site is given by:\n",
    "        \\begin{equation}\n",
    "        dE = -2 e(i,j) = 2 S(i,j) \\cdot [S(i+1,j) + S(i-i,j) + S(i,j+1) + S(i,j-1)].\n",
    "        \\end{equation}\n",
    "        Hence the maximum energy change per flip is $\\pm 8$.\n",
    "    <li> $M$ - The total magnetization $M$ of the lattice is given by:\n",
    "        \\begin{equation}\n",
    "        M = \\sum_{i,j} S(i,j).\n",
    "        \\end{equation}\n",
    "    <li> $C_V$ - The specific heat $C_v$ of the lattice is given by:\n",
    "        \\begin{equation}\n",
    "            C_v = \\frac{1}{N^2} \\frac{1}{T^2} \\left[\\langle E^2 \\rangle - \\langle E \\rangle ^2 \\right]\n",
    "        \\end{equation}\n",
    "    <li> $\\chi$ - The magnetic susceptibility $\\chi$ of the lattice is given by:\n",
    "        \\begin{equation}\n",
    "        \\chi = \\frac{1}{N^2} \\frac{1}{T} \\left[\\langle M^2 \\rangle - \\langle M \\rangle ^2 \\right]\n",
    "        \\end{equation}\n",
    "</ol>\n",
    "The prefactor $\\frac{1}{N^2}$ used for $C_V$ and $\\chi$ is there to normalize our results [3].\n",
    "\n",
    "## Implementation\n",
    "An object oriented approach was taken with methods and attributes held in the the relevant classes. A class called \"cy_Lattice\" contains all the methods and attributes (such as size of lattice, temperature, total energy, total magnetization, etc. ) related to the simulation of the Ising model. A class called \"cy_Figures\" contains the methods used to generate plots of the simulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "We start from a ground state (where all initial spins are aligned), and raise the temperature. At every temperature step, we measure and calculate each quantity. We then plot each quantity with respect to temperature, we also plot the evolution of the lattice as temperature increases.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Results\n",
    "The plots of thermodynamic quantities was simulated on a 12 by 12 lattice, and  on a 36 by 36 lattice. The model was left to equilibrate for 50000 steps. The lattice evolution plots were simulated on a 128 by 128 lattice.\n",
    "\n",
    "The peak of the specific heat capactiy and magnetic susceptibility reveal that the system underwent a phase transition at the critical temperature of $T_C \\approx 2.27$. The peak was more accurately simulated on the smaller lattice. Using a larger lattice resulted in a wider peak, increasing the error of the measured critical temperature. \n",
    "\n",
    "Above the critical temperature the system becomes paramagnetic. Thermal fluctuations causes the random flipping of spins. At high temperatures, the number of flips increases and inhibits the formation of domains. When the temperature gets high enough, thermal exicitations will dominate the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "At high temperatures ($T \\gg T_C$), the system had a random lattice pattern with net zero magnetization and is in its highest energy state. Conversely, at low temperatures ($T \\ll T_C$), there is minimal thermal excitations and the spins were more or less all aligned with each other in the lattice. The system was in the highest magnetization state and in the lowest energy state.\n",
    "\n",
    "As seen in the plot for magnetization, the lattice becomes a paramagnet at the critical temperature. The magnetization rapidly decreases to 0 as temperature is raised. At low temepratures, the magnetic susceptibility of the system is low due to the low state of energy the system is in. Magnetic susceptibility is increased (due to the increase in system energy) as temperatures increase up until the critical temperatuure. The magnetic susceptibility peaks at $T_C$, and at higher temperatures, thermal fluctuations dominate and magnetic susceptibility tends to 0. We see the same peak for specific heat capacity.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Further Improvments\n",
    "There is still much room for model improvement. Some possibilities are listed below.\n",
    "\n",
    "<ol>\n",
    "    <li> Introduce an external magnetic field and study the effects of hysteresis.\n",
    "    <li> Optimize the implemented Wolff algorithm.\n",
    "    <li> Perform finite size scaling and perform the critical exponents of the Ising model.\n",
    "    <li> Find a way to allow the model to stabilize into a stable state.\n",
    "</ol>\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "The implemented Ising model demonstrated the phase transition as well as the breaking of symmetry and the spontaneous magnetization below the critcal temperature, matching analytical results. The results for the critical temperature (for a 10 by 10 lattice) matched up to the theoretical value. It was concluded that the deviation was caused by insufficient computing power. The model was not given enough time to reach a stable state. As a result, the size of the lattice and time steps had to kept relatively small. The numerical results were strongly affected by the lattice size and time steps. The analytical solution for critical temperature assumed an infinite lattice, which is impossible to model. As a result, we expect that larger lattices will have larger deviations from the theoretical result. The language of choice Python also severely limited the computational speed of the program. Cython was introduced as a means to introduce the advantages of using a compiled language such as C. In reality, this program should have been written in C or Fortan for maximum computational efficiency.\n",
